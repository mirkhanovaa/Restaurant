        </br> Italian cuisine includes a lot of different products, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, cheese and so on. 
         A lot of peopleâ€™s favorite meal from this cuisine is pasta with meat sauce. The meat sauce is a combination between 
         marinara/pasta sauce and ground meat (beef, pork, or combination). Delicious!

        </br> Thai cuisine is a national cuisine of Thailand. A lot of people would agree with me that this particular cuisine differs 
        from any other Asian cuisine. Thai cuisine is very light, and it takes only a few minutes to make a whole meal. Yummy!
